This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First you need to create an `.env.local` file inside the root folder of the project and add your Open Weather Api Key to it:

```
OPENWEATHER_APPID=<apikey>
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install 

yarn dev
```
